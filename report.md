# CSI 4106 - Assignment 1 Report

## General questions
1. How do you represent a state in this problem?
2. What is the initial state, goal state and path cost in this problem?
3. What is the branching factor in this problem?
4. What is the proposed heuristic? Justify your choice.
5. Describe the environment properties. Justify your answers.


## Implementation questions
1. How do you represent the room/grid?
2. How do you represent the dirt and obstacles?
3. How do you represent a state in your implementation? (note that this is different from the Q1 in general questions)

## Code description
 > Provide a brief description of your implementation and the classes in your various packages.


## Comparative analysis
> Make a comparative table describing, for each search method (BFS, DFS, A*), the depth, path cost, the time taken, and the worst time and space complexity. What is your conclusion?
